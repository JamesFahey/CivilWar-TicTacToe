# Civil War - Tic Tac Toe

![Responsive screens](/assets/images/read-me/responsive.png)

## Project introduction

Civil War Tic Tac Toe takes the classic Tic Tac Toe (noughts and crosses) and incorporates Marvels production Civil War. As featured in the film, uses will decide which side they stand by choosing to play as either Captain America or Iron Man. The traditional X’s and O’s have been upgraded with icons representing the two characters. As per the original rules, the objective is to be the first player to get 3 of their icons (vertically, horizontally of diagonally) in a row. Once a result has been achieved, a relevant corresponding message will be presented to the user(s). 

## Website developers goals

•	Create a Tic Tac Toe game using Javascript 

•	Utilise the popularity of Marvel by incorporating it as the main theme 

•	Generate an enjoyable game to engage friends and family

## Target audience

Predominantly aiming towards Marvel and wider superhero fanbases, but also designed to appeal to those wanting to take advantage of a traditional and quick recreational game. Expecting to particularly capture the millennial generations appreciation of both classic games, as well as, modern fast paced and are of age in retrospect to the theme presented.


## User stories

### As a developer:

• To provide the user with a simple yet competitive multiplayer game.

• Set a tone of two sides in conflict.

• Provide the user with clear gameplay instructions.

### As a new user:

• A clear understanding the rules and operations of the game.

• To feel as though I am playing an official Marvel game.

• To become immersed in the story behind the game.

• The option to choose between the two sides.

• A player indicator, to able to visually identify who’s turn it is. 

• Have the opportunity of either friends/family but also an AI as an opponent.

• • Once the game is completed, the accessibility to quickly play again.

## Website structure

The use of bold imagery immediately sets and accentuates conflict between the two opposing sides to give the user an immersive experience. Initially pages are kept minimalistic, so not to distract from the tone being set. The site is fully responsive and working consistently across all devices, maintaining optimum user satisfaction. The user will experience a fully interactive site, from the initial character selection to its corresponding game of Tic Tac Toe. 

## Wireframes

I used the website wireframes.cc to create my wireframes.

## Surface

## Colours

### Colours used throughout the site:

•	Background: ##696969

•	Font colour: #fff

•	Button colour: #3a3a3a

•	Error message area: rgba(175, 85, 82, 0.7)

•	Winning message background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)

•	Player indicator: Red and Blue

## Fonts

As there was limited text throughout the site I chose to use Lato for all aspects with Sans Serif as the fall back.

## Images

### I used images from:

•	pngkey.com was used for the ironman gameplay icon 

•	toppng.com was used for the Captain America gameplay icon 

•	best-wallpaper.net/ was used for the player select pages

•	https://dribbble.com/ was used for the player indicator images


## Features

## Existing features

## Home Page Image

The homepage demonstrates to the user the commencing battle between two sides. The choice of image effectively conveys the chosen theme of the game. 

![Homepage image](/assets/images/read-me/Home-page.png)

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar enables the user to determine if they are playing singularly, against an AI or play with friends/family. Achieved by selecting the ‘one player’ or ‘two player’ buttons respectively. The user will als be provided with an ‘how to play’ option, displaying the game rules

## Player Select Image

Again, the choice of image was carefully selected to perpetuate the previously mentioned theme of conflict. 

![Player Select image](/assets/images/read-me/player-choice.png)

## Player Select 

Here, the user must decide their alliance by choosing to play as either Captain America or Ironman. The user can also return to the main menu to alter their character selection, game type or to check the rules. As seen in the image above. 

## Player Indicator 

Using JavaScript, the player indicator will highlight the player currently taking their turn. Once the player has made their move, the highlighting line will switch to the opposing players character icon. However, this function has been removed and altered in the one player option and instead, is used to establish the human player. In the section in both game modes the user can also return to the main menu.

## Testing

### Functionality testing

Throughout the project Chrome developer tools have been used to continually check new implementations and solve any problems encountered.

## Compatibility testing

The site has been tested across multiple platforms and devices. Initial testing was completed on chrome developer tools ensuring the site was fully responsive across all screen sizes.

Further testing was done using different hardware devices including Samsung Galaxy S20, Iphone 6s plus, Apple Ipad . The site has also been tested by friends and family successfully on a wider range of devices.

## Issues during site development

### Implementing a minimax algorithm

Upon completion of the 2 player option, it was decided the project would greatly benefit from a 1 player option. Therefore, implementing an AI player and corresponding minimax algorithm into the existing code was attempted. This was troublesome due to the number of ways of coding a Tic Tac Toe game. The guides for executing a minimax algorithm, in some areas, were significantly different to the code I had used, and could not be merged with the existing code. Consequently the project was restarted, following a guide for the 1 player option.   

### Implementing a character select function

From the player select screen the goal was to create a function that would determine which character played first dependent upon the user’s choice. I attempted using a query string value to determine which player to initialise. This worked to some extent as I was able to pull the string value over to the gameboard. However, this method proved unsuccessful in linking the string to the relevant image required for the gameboard. I determined a disproportionate amount of time was being used resolving this issue. Although the outcome was achievable implementing a work around utilised more effective time management. Thus, creating two game pages, one for each character always being set to the current player.

## Validator Testing

•	HTML - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

•	CSS - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

•	Javascript - No errors were found when passing through the official (JSHint) validator

## Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub.Pages. The project was developed using Gitpod where the git version control system was used to commit all changes. The changes were then saved to Github using the push command.

In order to deploy the project the following steps occurred;

•	Log in to GitHub and click on repository to deploy (CivilWar-TicTacToe)

•	select Settings and find GitHub Pages section 

•	from source select none and then Milestone-Projects branch.

•	click save and page was deployed after auto-refresh.
